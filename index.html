              Hello there! I'm Little Red Riding Hood, but you can call me Red
              for short.
              <span
                >I'm just a simple girl from the woods, with a passion for
                exploring the great outdoors and spending time with my dear
                grandma.
              </span>

            <article>
              <div>
                My favorite pastime is wandering through the enchanting forest,
                taking in the fresh scent of pine trees, listening to the
                chirping birds, and feeling the gentle breeze against my rosy
                cheeks.
              </div>
              <p>
                I always wear my signature red hooded cloak; it keeps me cozy
                and warm during my adventures.
              </p>
              <div>
                Speaking of adventures, I'm known for my courage and
                determination. Whether it's delivering goodies to my grandmother
                or facing challenges head-on, I'm always up for an exciting
                journey. Of course, I have to be careful when I meet strangers
                in the woods, but my instincts are pretty sharp!
              </div>
              <div>
                I must admit, my love for baked treats is undeniable. I often
                bring
                <strong>delicious goodies</strong> to share with my grandmother,
                and I'm a firm believer in the power of a warm, freshly baked
                pie to bring joy to the world.
              </div>

                So, that's me in a nutshellâ€”Little Red Riding Hood, a nature
                enthusiast, a lover of sweet treats, and someone who's not
                afraid to face the big, bad wolf when necessary. Thanks for
                taking the time to get to know me a little better!
